## Instrument files

This folder contains instrument files for ISIS instruments in both NeXus and McStas formats.

The NeXus files were generated by the [horace_nxs_inst.py](../scripts/horace_nxs_inst.py) in this repository.
Instrument files for LET, MAPS and MERLIN are readable by Horace and can be used by it for
resolution calculations.

The McStas `.instr` file here was used to define the guide and detector components in the NeXus files,
via [McStasScript](https://github.com/PaNOSC-ViNYL/McStasScript).
To run the McStas instruments you also need the ISIS
[moderator files](https://github.com/ISISNeutronMuon/mcstas/blob/master/docs/ISIS-Moderator-files.md).
